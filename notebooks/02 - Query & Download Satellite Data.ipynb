    "A number of satellites take snapshots of the Earth’s surface from space. The images recorded by these remote sensors represent a very precious data source for any activity that involves monitoring changes on Earth. \n",

    "Satellite imagery is typically provided in the form of geo-spatial raster data, with the measurements in each grid cell (“pixel”) being associated to accurate geographic coordinate information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will explore how to access open satellite data using Python. In particular, we will consider the Sentinel-2 data collections hosted at SARA and AWS. This dataset consists of multi-band optical images acquired by the two satellites of the Sentinel-2 mission and it is continuously updated with new images."
