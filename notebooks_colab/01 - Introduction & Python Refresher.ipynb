    "- If the value is a string raise the same error (hint: use the [isinstance()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_isinstance.asp) function against `str` type) -\n",
    "- 3 times over, sets a new `reflectance` value to be `0.1` plus the old value of `reflectance`, then multiplied by the old `reflectance` value \n",
    "- After those 3 iterations, add `0.01` to `reflectance`\n",
    "- If the value of `reflectance` is greater than 1, it sets the value of `reflectance` to 1.\n",
