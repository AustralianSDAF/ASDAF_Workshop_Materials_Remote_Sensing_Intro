    "# What is Numba?\n",
    "Python has several features that make it a great prototyping language, but it's native speed is often criticised. While this is ultimately down to the implementation, it is still an issue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy and several other libraries will wrap compiled C, C++, or Fortran code to try to have the benefits of Python without giving up too much speed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) takes a different approach. When you wrap a Python function with a `numba` compilation 'decorator', it will try to compile it using the state-of-the-art LLVM compiler. \n",
    "One drawback is that it will only run with a subset of Python and `numpy` functionality - most libraries will not be able to be compiled.\n",
    "One of the better features of `numba` is that you can write loops and the compiler will automatically optimise your code to be as fast or faster than single line `numpy` functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"\n",
    "You don't need to replace the Python interpreter, run a separate compilation step, or even have a C/C++ compiler installed. Just apply one of the Numba decorators to your Python function, and Numba does the rest. \n",
